## 品牌理念

「**ExitTaiwan 出台灣**」是一個為了**幫助台灣人走出台灣，探索世界**而誕生的生活品牌。

不管出國是為了旅遊、交換學生、留學、打工度假、工作、甚至移民等，你都能在這個網站上找到相關的資訊。

## 品牌堅持

在這個充滿事事求效率的網路世界，我們選擇慢下來，希望每個路過的人都能花剛好的時間、得到期望該得到的幫助，我們透過以下堅持來實現這件事：

- 我們堅持不透過彈出式及展示型廣告盈利，還給讀者最乾淨、簡潔而有幫助的閱讀體驗。
- 我們堅持不經營社群媒體，因為沒有一個人的人生值得和另一個人的人生比較，我們相信口耳相傳的力量。
- 我們堅持只和信譽高的商家合作，目前主要營利方式僅透過行銷合作連結，推薦團隊成員親自體驗過後感到滿意的服務＆產品，且透過這些連結購買時讀者不需要付出任何額外的費用。

如果你願意支持高品質的圖文內容，你可以透過網站上的連結進行購買的動作，或是直接贊助我們（[**每月贊助**](https://exittaiwan.gumroad.com/l/membership)｜[**單次贊助**](https://exittaiwan.gumroad.com/coffee)）幫助團隊運營，持續為你提供實用資訊。

## About ExitTaiwan

### Brand Mission

ExitTaiwan is a lifestyle brand dedicated to helping Taiwanese explore the world beyond Taiwan.

Whether readers are going abroad for travel, student exchange, study, working holiday, work, or even immigration, Taiwanese readers can find relevant information on this website.

### Our Commitment

In an online world that values efficiency above all, we choose to slow down, hoping each website visitor can spend just the right amount of time here and receive the help they seek. We achieve this by upholding the following principles:

- We are committed to *not profiting through pop-up ads*, ensuring a clean, streamlined, and helpful reading experience for our audience.
- We choose *not to manage social media*, as we believe no one’s life should be compared to another’s. Instead, we trust in the power of word-of-mouth.
- We only collaborate with reputable businesses. Currently, our main revenue comes from affiliate marketing links, recommending services and products that our team members have personally tested and found satisfactory. Through these links, readers incur no additional costs when making purchases.

If you’d like to support our high-quality content, you can make purchases through our links or consider donating directly ([**monthly**](https://exittaiwan.gumroad.com/l/membership) or [**one-time**](https://exittaiwan.gumroad.com/coffee)) to help keep our team running and providing valuable information.
